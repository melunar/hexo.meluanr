Girl you melt me like ice and whiskey
你像冰威士忌一样将我融化
With those blue fling looks that you give me,
投来的忧郁神情不言而喻
You can't hide what's inside
你学不会掩饰自己
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again.
万分难过，感到你又要离我而去
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we been doin?
我们为什么像以前一样，永远达不成共识
Every time we lie girl we're losing
每撒谎一次都是在失去自己
So why should we spend Saturday night alone,
我们不该孤独的度过周末的夜晚
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
如果我用电话把你召唤，可否化好妆陪我
Make it up as we go along
勇敢向前
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
追逐夜晚涌动的梦想
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
她的眼睛闪着微光就像灯光（就像灯光）
Get a little higher (get a little higher),
情绪再高涨一点吧（高涨一点）
Sippin' on fire
像被火点燃一样

You act like you don't know what you're missing,
你表现的好像不知道自己正在迷失
Every time you end up back with him
每次你从他那里回来
Cuz' it's safe. And you're scared.
尽管你毫发无损，却还是
Of everything you're feeling when we're burning the midnight down again
在外面消磨夜晚的时候害怕自己产生的情绪
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we been doin?
我们为什么像以前一样，永远达不成共识
Every time we lie girl we're losing
每撒谎一次都是在失去自己
So why should we spend Saturday night alone,
我们不该孤独的度过周末的夜晚
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
如果我用电话把你召唤，可否化好妆陪我
Make it up as we go along
勇敢向前
Pull and all nighter chasing that desire
追逐夜晚涌动的梦想
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
她的眼睛闪着微光就像灯光（就像灯光）
Get a little higher (get a little higher),
情绪再高涨一点吧（高涨一点）
Sippin' on fire
像被火点燃一样

Every goodbye is bitter sweet,
亲爱的，每次分开都苦涩难捱
So why should we fight what we both need?
那为什么我们忽视了彼此的爱
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we been doin?
我们为什么像以前一样，永远达不成共识
Every time we lie girl we're losing
每撒谎一次都是在失去自己
So why should we spend Saturday night alone,
我们不该孤独的度过周末的夜晚
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
